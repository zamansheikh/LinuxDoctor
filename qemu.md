If your Arch Linux ISO is located at `C:\Users\zaman\Downloads\arch.iso`, you need to ensure that WSL can access this file. In WSL, Windows drives are mounted under `/mnt/`, so your ISO path in WSL will be:

```
/mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso
```

Here’s how you can proceed with the installation using your ISO file:

---

### Steps to Install Arch Linux with Your ISO Path:

1. **Create a 50 GB Disk Image:**
   Run the following command in your WSL terminal to create a 50 GB disk image:
   ```bash
   qemu-img create -f qcow2 arch.qcow2 50G
   ```

2. **Run the QEMU Command with Your ISO Path:**
   Use the following command to start the Arch Linux installation:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -accel kvm -vga virtio -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso -boot d
   ```

   Here’s what each option does:
   - `-accel kvm`: Enables hardware acceleration (if supported).
   - `-vga virtio`: Uses the Virtio GPU for better performance.
   - `-m 8G`: Allocates 8 GB of RAM to the virtual machine.
   - `-smp 4`: Allocates 4 CPU cores to the virtual machine.
   - `-drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2`: Uses the `arch.qcow2` disk image you created.
   - `-cdrom /mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso`: Mounts your Arch Linux ISO file.
   - `-boot d`: Boots from the CD-ROM (ISO file) first.

3. **Install Arch Linux:**
   - Once the QEMU virtual machine starts, follow the on-screen instructions to install Arch Linux.
   - You’ll need to partition the virtual disk (`arch.qcow2`) and install Arch Linux on it.

4. **Boot into Arch Linux After Installation:**
   After the installation is complete, you can boot into Arch Linux using the following command (without the `-cdrom` option):
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -accel kvm -vga virtio -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2
   ```

---

### Notes:
- Ensure that the path `/mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso` is correct and accessible from WSL.
- If you encounter permission issues, make sure the ISO file has the appropriate read permissions.
- The `arch.qcow2` file will grow dynamically as you use the virtual machine, up to the maximum size of 50 GB.

The output from `grep -E --color '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo` shows that your CPU supports **Intel VT-x (vmx)** but not **AMD-V (svm)**. This means your system is using an **Intel CPU**, and the `svm` warnings are expected because `svm` is specific to AMD CPUs.

The issue you're encountering (`host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.svm [bit 2]`) is because QEMU is trying to use AMD-specific virtualization features (`svm`) on an Intel CPU. To fix this, you need to ensure QEMU is configured correctly for your Intel CPU.

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

#### 1. **Verify Virtualization is Enabled in BIOS/UEFI**
   - Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings.
   - Look for **Intel VT-x** or **Intel Virtualization Technology** and ensure it is enabled.
   - Save the changes and reboot.

#### 2. **Check Virtualization Status in Windows**
   - Open Task Manager (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`).
   - Go to the **Performance** tab.
   - Check the **Virtualization** status at the bottom:
     - If it says **Enabled**, virtualization is active.
     - If it says **Disabled**, virtualization is not enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.

#### 3. **Modify the QEMU Command**
   Since you have an Intel CPU, you should use the `vmx` feature instead of `svm`. Update your QEMU command to explicitly use `vmx`:

   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -accel kvm -vga virtio -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso -boot d -cpu host
   ```

   The `-cpu host` option ensures that QEMU uses the host CPU's features (including `vmx`).

#### 4. **Use Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX) as an Alternative**
   If KVM is not working, you can use **Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX)** as an alternative:

   1. **Enable WHPX:**
      - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
        ```powershell
        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
        ```
      - Restart your computer.

   2. **Modify the QEMU Command:**
      Replace `-accel kvm` with `-accel whpx`:
      ```bash
      qemu-system-x86_64 -accel whpx -vga virtio -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso -boot d
      ```

#### 5. **Fallback to Software Emulation (TCG)**
   If neither KVM nor WHPX works, you can use QEMU's software emulation (TCG). This is slower but will work on any system:

   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -vga virtio -m 8G -smp 4 -drive file=arch.qcow2,format=qcow2 -cdrom /mnt/c/Users/zaman/Downloads/arch.iso -boot d
   ```

---

### Summary of Fixes:
1. Ensure **Intel VT-x** is enabled in BIOS/UEFI.
2. Use `-cpu host` in the QEMU command to leverage Intel's `vmx` feature.
3. Use **WHPX** if KVM is not available.
4. Fallback to software emulation (TCG) as a last resort.

### Verify the Fix:
After making the changes, run the QEMU command again. If everything is set up correctly, the `svm` warnings should disappear, and the virtual machine should start without issues.
