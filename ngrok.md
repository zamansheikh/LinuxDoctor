## Step 2: Install ngrok

### On Windows
1. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
2. Move the `ngrok.exe` file to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\ngrok`).
3. Add the folder to your system's PATH variable (optional but recommended):
   - Open **Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings**.
   - Click **Environment Variables**.
   - Edit the **Path** variable under **System Variables** and add the folder path.

### On macOS/Linux
1. Open a terminal.
2. Move the downloaded file to `/usr/local/bin` for global use:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/ngrok /usr/local/bin/ngrok
   ```
3. Grant execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ngrok
   ```

## Step 3: Connect Your ngrok Account

1. Log in to your ngrok account on the website.
2. Locate your **authtoken** in the dashboard.
3. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with the token from your ngrok dashboard.

## Step 4: Start ngrok

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to expose your local server (e.g., running on port 8000):
   ```bash
   ngrok http http://localhost:8080
   ```
   Or use you local IP and PORT:
    ```bash
   ngrok http http://192.168.10.70:3000
   ```
4. ngrok will provide a public URL that you can share to access your local server from the internet.

## Step 5: Additional Features

### Subdomain (Pro Feature)
To use a custom subdomain (Pro plan required):
```bash
ngrok http --subdomain=your-subdomain 8000
```

- Open [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) in your browser.

## Step 6: Stop ngrok
To stop ngrok, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running ngrok.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: 'Command not found'**: Ensure ngrok is installed correctly and added to the PATH.
