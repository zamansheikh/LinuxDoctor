Hosting a website using **Nginx** is a straightforward process. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up and host a website using Nginx on a Linux server.

---

### **Step 1: Install Nginx**
1. Update your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
3. Start and enable Nginx to run on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Configure Firewall**
If you have a firewall enabled (e.g., `ufw`), allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```
Verify the status:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Website Files**
1. Create a directory for your website files:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/yourdomain.com/html
   ```
2. Assign ownership of the directory to your user (replace `youruser` with your username):
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R youruser:youruser /var/www/yourdomain.com/html
   ```
3. Set the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/yourdomain.com
   ```
4. Create a sample `index.html` file:
   ```bash
   nano /var/www/yourdomain.com/html/index.html
   ```
   Add some HTML content:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Welcome to Your Domain!</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Success! Your Nginx server is working!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Create an Nginx Server Block**
1. Create a new server block configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Add the following configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;

       root /var/www/yourdomain.com/html;
       index index.html;

       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```
3. Enable the server block by creating a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```
4. Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
5. Reload Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Update DNS Records**
1. Go to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) and update the DNS records:
   - Set an **A record** for `yourdomain.com` to point to your server's IP address.
   - Set an **A record** for `www.yourdomain.com` to point to your server's IP address.
2. Wait for DNS propagation (this can take a few minutes to a few hours).

---

### **Step 6: Access Your Website**
Once DNS propagation is complete, open a browser and navigate to:
```
http://yourdomain.com
```
You should see your website!

---

### **Step 7: Secure Your Website with SSL (Optional)**
To secure your website with HTTPS, you can use **Let's Encrypt** to obtain a free SSL certificate:
1. Install Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```
2. Obtain and install the SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to use HTTPS. Test the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
4. Verify that your site is accessible via HTTPS:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

---

### **Step 8: Manage Nginx**
- **Start Nginx**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  ```
- **Stop Nginx**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop nginx
  ```
- **Restart Nginx**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
- **Check Nginx Status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  ```

   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
   ```
2. Configure Nginx to use the SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite
   ```
   Update the configuration to include SSL:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       listen [::]:443 ssl;

       ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

       root /var/www/mywebsite/html;
       index index.html;

       server_name _;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Nginx to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```
4. Access your website securely:
   ```
   https://your-server-ip
   ```

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  ```
- **Stop Nginx**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop nginx
  ```

The warning message you are seeing:

```
[warn] 31518#31518: conflicting server name "_" on 0.0.0.0:80, ignored
[warn] 31518#31518: conflicting server name "_" on [::]:80, ignored
```

indicates that multiple server blocks are trying to use `server_name _;` on port **80**, causing a conflict.

### **Solution: Fix the Server Block Conflict**

#### **Option 1: Specify an IP Instead of `_`**
Instead of `server_name _;`, explicitly set your server's IP address:

Edit the Nginx configuration file for your site:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite
```
Update:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    root /var/www/mywebsite/html;
    index index.html;

    server_name 192.168.1.100;  # Replace with your actual server IP

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
Save the file and exit.

#### **Option 2: Remove Other Conflicting Server Blocks**
1. Check existing Nginx configurations:
   ```bash
   ls /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```
   If you see **default**, it's likely causing the conflict.

2. Disable the default configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   ```
3. Restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

#### **Option 3: Use a More Specific Server Name**
Instead of using `_`, define a unique name like `localhost`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    root /var/www/mywebsite/html;
    index index.html;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
Restart Nginx after making changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

After applying these changes, run:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
and ensure there are no warnings.
